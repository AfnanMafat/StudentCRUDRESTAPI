Student CRUD REST API
Overview
This is a Student CRUD REST API built using Spring Boot and Spring Data JPA. The API allows you to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing student data. The data is stored in a MYSQL database. The application exposes various endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting student records.

This project demonstrates the power and flexibility of Spring Boot for creating RESTful services, and Spring Data JPA for easy integration with relational databases.

Features
Create: Add new student records to the database.
Read: Retrieve all students or a single student by ID.
Update: Modify an existing studentâ€™s details.
Delete: Remove a student from the database.
Database Integration: Integrated with a MYSQL database
RESTful API: Exposes endpoints to interact with the data in a RESTful manner.

Technologies Used
Spring Boot: A framework to build Java-based applications quickly.
Spring Data JPA: Simplifies database operations using JPA (Java Persistence API).
MySQL: Databases for storing student records.
REST API: Exposes endpoints for performing CRUD operations over HTTP.
Maven: Dependency management and build tool.
Jackson: For JSON processing in the request and response bodies.
